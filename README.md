# indie-l10n-scout
An data analysis tool for indie game developers, publishers, and localization professionals to discover and quantify the market potential of localizing their games into new languages on Steam.
This tool moves beyond guesswork by providing data-driven insights. It compares your game against thousands of similar titles on Steam to identify the languages with the highest potential return on investment (ROI).
Core Feature: Generates a "Market Potential Multiplier" to clearly show the estimated market size increase from adding a new language.
Future Goal: To expand from a single-language focus to a comprehensive, global analysis tool supporting any language on Steam, empowering developers to make strategic decisions for their worldwide releases.
